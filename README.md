Here's a brief overview of the provided backend and frontend code for the RAG model AI chatbot:

### Backend (Java - Spring Boot):

1. **Controller (ChatController.java):**
   - Defines RESTful API endpoints for uploading text and receiving user queries.
   - `uploadText()` method handles POST requests to `/api/chat/upload` endpoint for uploading text. Replace the placeholder with actual text processing, embedding, and database storage logic.
   - `chat()` method handles POST requests to `/api/chat/ask` endpoint for user queries. Replace the placeholder with actual RAG model integration to generate responses.

2. **Main Application (ChatbotApplication.java):**
   - Bootstrap class for the Spring Boot application.
   - Starts the Spring Boot application.

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):

1. **HTML (index.html):**
   - Basic HTML structure for the chatbot UI.
   - Includes input field for user messages and a button to send messages.
   - Displays chat messages inside a container.

2. **CSS (styles.css):**
   - Provides simple styling for the chatbot UI.
   - Styles the container, chat message container, user input field, and send button.

3. **JavaScript (script.js):**
   - Defines functions to handle user input and display messages.
   - `sendMessage()` function sends user messages to the backend API, receives responses, and displays them.
   - `displayMessage()` function displays messages in the chat interface, distinguishing between user messages and bot responses.

### Integration and Usage:

- The backend and frontend communicate via RESTful API calls.
- Upon receiving a user query, the frontend sends a request to the backend `/api/chat/ask` endpoint.
- The backend processes the query, retrieves relevant information from the database, generates a response using the RAG model, and sends it back to the frontend.
- The frontend then displays the response in the chat interface.

This code provides a foundation for building a RAG model AI chatbot. You'll need to fill in the placeholder logic with actual implementations for text processing, embeddings, RAG model integration, and database operations to create a fully functional chatbot. Additionally, ensure to handle errors, security, and scalability aspects based on your requirements.
